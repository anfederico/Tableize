## Code Examples

#### Mining Twitter

```python
# Credentials to access Twitter API 
ACCESS_TOKEN    = 'XXXXXXXXXX'
ACCESS_SECRET   = 'XXXXXXXXXX'
CONSUMER_KEY    = 'XXXXXXXXXX'
CONSUMER_SECRET = 'XXXXXXXXXX'
Credentials = [ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_SECRET, CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET] 

# Create an instance of the TwitterAxe class
axe = TwitterAxe(Credentials)

minePeriod        = 60*5     # Mine Twitter for 5 minutes
requestFrequency  = 30*1     # Request tweets every 30 seconds
analyzeFrequency  = 60*1     # Analyze tweets every 1 minute
requestAmount     = 100      # With each request pull 100 tweets (max = 100)
similarityCutoff  = 90       # Filter out tweets with 90% similarity (default = 90)

# Start mining
axe.mine("Apple", minePeriod, requestFrequency, analyzeFrequency, requestAmount, similarityCutoff)
```

#### Spam Filtering
```python
stringOne = "Lawsuits are piling up against Tesla Motors (TSLA) over the Solar City (SCTY) merger"
stringTwo = "Lawsuits piling up against Tesla Motors (TSLA) with the Solar City (SCTY) merger"
print similarityScore(stringOne, stringTwo)
# 95.12%

stringTwo   = "Lawsuits piling up against Tesla Motors (TSLA) with the Solar City (SCTY) merger"
stringThree = "Bad news for Tesla Motors (TSLA) over the Solar City (SCTY) merger"
print similarityScore(stringTwo, stringThree)
# 82.19%

stringThree = "Bad news for Tesla Motors (TSLA) over the Solar City (SCTY) merger"
stringFour  = "Tesla Motors (TSLA) will not need to raise equity or debt before the end of the year"
print similarityScore(stringThree, stringFour)
# 59.33%
```
